Write a Windows Forms Application that prompts the user to enter the number of seconds elapsed; include a screenshot of your program running with successful output. The program should convert the value as follows:
1. If the number of seconds is greater than or equal to 60, display the number of minutes in that many seconds.
2. If the number of seconds is greater than or equal to 3600, display the number of hours in that many seconds.
3. If the number of seconds is greater than or equal to 86,400, display the number of days in that many seconds.
